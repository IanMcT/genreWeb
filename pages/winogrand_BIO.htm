<p><b>Winogrand, Garry</b><br>
American, 1928-1984</p>
<p>Winogrand was born in New York City. He began photographing while in the
United States Air Force in 1946-1947. He studied painting at City College of the
City of New York in 1947 and painting and photography at Columbia University in
New York City in 1948. In 1951 he attended Alexey Brodovitch's photojournalism
class at the New School for Social Research in New York City. From 1952 to 1969
he worked as a freelance photojournalist and advertising photographer with the
Ptix Agency and Brackman Associates. His work was published regularly in <i>Sports
Illustrated, Colliers</i>, and other national magazines.</p>
<p>Winogrand's first one-man show was held at Image Gallery in New York City
in 1960. One of several factors in the early 1960s powerfully affecting him and
his work was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. He photographed extensively for
himself in New York City streets while making the rounds with his commercial
work. Robert Frank joined Walker Evans as an important influence during this period. In 1963 Winogrand had a solo
exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. He soon began a series of remarkable
photographs in New York City zoos and the Coney Island Aquarium, published in his book <i>The Animals</i> (1969).
Animals and humans in another human-made environment, the rodeo, were the
subject of <i>Stock Photographs: Fort Worth Fat
Stock Show and Rodeo</i> (1980).</p>
<p>Winogrand was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Photography in 1964, and
he photographed extensively in California and the American Southwest for the
next year.</p>
<p>In 1966 Winogrand's work was exhibited with that of Lee Friedlander, Duane
Michals, Bruce Davidson, and Danny Lyon in <i>Toward a Social Landscape</i> at
George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. He showed the following year with
Friedlander and Diane Arbus in the <i>New Documents</i> exhibition at the Museum
of Modern Art.</p>
<p>Winogrand received a second Guggenheim Fellowship in 1969. His work of the
early 1970s was concerned with &quot;the effect of the media on events.&quot; A
major show of this work, called Public Relations, was held at the Museum of
Modern Art in 1977.</p>
<p>Winogrand received a grant from the New York State
Council on the Arts in 1971. He was the recipient of an award from the National
Endowment for the Arts in 1975 and a third Guggenheim Fellowship in 1979. He
exhibited widely including shows at MIT (1978), the Santa Barbara Museum in
California (1979), and Light Gallery in New York City (1975, 1976, 1979, and a
major retrospective in 1981), and his work is many major collections. He taught
at a number of schools, including the University of Texas, Austin, and the Art
Institute of Chicago.</p>
