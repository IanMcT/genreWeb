<h2>Lee Friedlander</h2>

<p><b>Friedlander, Lee</b><br>
American, 1934 -</p>
<p>Friedlander was born in Aberdeen, Washington, and was introduced to
photography at age 14. He studied under Edward Kaminski at the Art Center in Los
Angeles from 1953 to 1955. He shot portraits of jazz musicians in New York and
New Orleans for album covers in the late 1950s and has made his livelihood as a
freelance commercial photographer and as a teacher at UCLA, the University of
Minnesota, and Rice University. His work has appeared in <i>Esquire, Art in
America, McCall's, Seventeen, Sports Illustrated</i>, and other periodicals.</p>
<p>Friedlander's early work was influenced by Eugene
Atget, Walker
Evans, and Robert Frank. He was
awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1960 and again in 1962 for photographic
studies of the changing American scene. His images often featured undramatic
views from automobiles and a variety of reflections and images within images. An
extensive series of self-portraits is marked by the presence of the photographer's reflection
or shadow.</p>
<p>Friedlander was given a one-man show at George Eastman House in Rochester,
New York, in 1963. His work was included with that of Garry
Winogrand, Duane Michals,
Bruce Davidson, and Danny Lyon in the <i>Toward a Social Landscape</i>
exhibition at George Eastman House is 1966. The following year he exhibited with
Winogrand and Diane Arbusin the show <i>New Documents</i> at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.</p>
<p>Friedlander was responsible for the discovery and preservation of the work
of E. J. Bellocq in 1968. His prints from Bellocq's glass plates were published
as <i>Storyville Portraits</i> in 1970. He also collaborated with the artist Jim Dine on a number of projects
in the late 1960s. From 1968 to 1971 Friedlander concentrated on a series of
party photographs taken with harsh flash. Slides of this work were exhibited at
the Museum of Modern Art in 1972. In the same year he was awarded an individual
fellowship in photography by the National Endowment for the Arts. During the
1970s Friedlander worked on series of trees, flowers, and bushes, as well as a
major project concerning American monuments.</p>
<p>Friedlander photographed the Sculpture Garden of the
Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D. C. in 1975-1976. A major retrospective of his
work was held at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, New York, in 1978. He
received a Friends of Photography award in 1980 and lives and works in New City,
New York.&nbsp;</p>
