<h2>Edward Weston</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none">EDWARD WESTON from '<i><b>America and Photography</b></i>' (1929)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none">Photography in America is in a sadly anemic condition, — only a few
strong figures outstanding. Generally speaking, the stage has been held by
dextrous technicians who depart as far as possible from photographic quality: or
on the other hand by those who think photography an easy way to release and
expose their excess personal emotions or aspirations. They could not do so with
such an honest, direct, uncompromising medium without resorting to tricks, —
diffusion of focus, manipulation of prints, or worse, recording of
calculated expressions and postures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none">Hundreds of tired businessmen or tradesmen, and idle women, play with
photography as a holiday hobby, — then offer their results as 'art!'</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none">Opposing this facile approach is a photography free from technical tricks
and incoherent emotionalism. The finished print is previsioned on the ground
glass while focussing, the final result felt at that moment, — in all its
values and related forms: the shutter's release fixes forever these values and
forms, — developing [,] printing becomes only a careful carrying on of the
original idea.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none">Those who feel nothing, or not completely at the time of exposure, relying
upon subsequent manipulation to reach an unpremeditated end, are predestined to
failure.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none">Nothing can be transmitted to another unless an original problem has been
felt, conceived and solved: not a trivial problem of clever decoration or the
personal ego, but the recording of the very quintessence and interdependence of
all life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none">Vincent Van Gogh wrote: 'A feeling for things in themselves is much more
important than a sense of the pictorial.'</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none">Photographers take note!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none">With a medium capable of revealing more than the eye sees, 'things in
themselves' could be recorded, clearly, powerfully: but instead these
'pictorial' photographers resort to impressionistic blur.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none">Impressionism is scepticism; it puts what one casually notices above what
one positively knows.</p>
<p>Not to interpret in terms of personal fancy, transitory and superficial
moods, but present with utmost exactness, — this is the way in photography,
— and it is not an easy way. Vision, sensitive reaction, the knowing of life,
all are requisite in those who would direct through the lens forms from out of
nature, — maybe only a fragment, but indicating or symbolising life rhythms.</p>
<p>I have written of photography as 'direct, honest, uncompromising,' — and
so it is when used in its purity, if the worker himself is equally sincere and
understanding in selection and presentation. Then it has a power and vitality
which moves and holds the spectator. There can be no lie in such photography. No
human hand of possible frailty has in the recording lessened its pristine
beauty, nor misrepresented its meaning, destroying significance.</p>
<p>A once well known photographer stated as an argument for controlled or
manipulated prints that photography needed the vitalising influence of the hand.
Then why photograph at all! The artist of brush and palette has a trained hand
with which to better execute and express all things in a better way. Photography
has, as already indicated, intrinsic value and use, apart from any other medium.</p>
<p>I have allowed the word 'art' to enter in? In this day of ever changing
values it is immaterial whether or not photography can be labelled art. It is of
our day, — we understand, respond to and need photography as a vital
contemporary expression.</p>
<p>But for the sake of argument, — the difference between good and bad art
in any medium or of any age lies in the creative mind rather than in skill of
hands. The way of seeing is what counts and that is conditioned by the artist's
attitude, not by his skill as craftsman. Given a big enough artist and lie will
make of himself a consummate craftsman to better express his thoughts.</p>
