A young couple embrace beside a pavement cafe; passers-by adopt a middle-distance stare or turn to catch the action unfold; a steady stream of taffic floods by, and a rather regal-looking building provides a painterly backdrop. What appears to be a fleeting moment of passion is in fact a reconstruction of something seen earlier, a play of life on the streets of Paris acted by two students, and directed by photographer Robert Doisneau. The photograph, Le Raiser de I'H6tel de Ville, 1950 {The kiss in front of the Hotel de Ville), became Doisneau's most successful picture, a symbol of love, romance, passion and, most significantly, France. The image led to play {Sealed with a Kiss), a series of calendars, postcards, posters, and - just before Doisneau's death in 1994 - a rather messy court case.
