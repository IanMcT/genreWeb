<h2>Edward Weston</h2>

<p><b>Weston, Edward</b><br>
American, 1886-1958</p>
<p>Edward Henry Weston was born in Highland Park, Illinois, and raised in
Chicago. He attended Oakland Grammar School and received his first camera, a
Bull's-Eye #2, from his father in 1902. He began photographing in his spare time
in Chicago parks while working as an errand boy and salesman for Marshall Field
and Company. In 1906 Weston traveled to California where he worked as a
door-to-door portrait photographer. From 1908 to 1911 he attended the Illinois
College of Photography, spending his summers in California working as a printer
in photographic studios.</p>
<p>Weston operated his own portrait studio between 1911 and 1922 in Tropico,
California. He became successful working in a soft-focus, Pictorial style,
winning many salon and professional awards. After viewing an exhibition of
modern art at the San Francisco World's Fair in 1915, Weston became more and
more dissatisfied with his own work. By 1920 he was experimenting with
semi-abstractions in a hard-edged style.</p>
<p>In 1922 Weston traveled to New York City, where he met Alfred
Stieglitz, Paul Strand; and Charles Sheeler. His photographs of the ARMCO Steelworks in Ohio at this time marked a turning point
in his career. These industrial photographs, similar to work by Sheeler, were
true &quot;straight&quot; images: unpretentious, and true to the reality before
the photographer. Weston later wrote, &quot;the camera should be used for a
recording of life, for rendering the very substance and quintessence of the
thing itself, whether it be polished steel or palpitating flesh.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1923 Weston moved to Mexico City where he opened a studio with his
apprentice and lover Tina Modotti, of whom he made important portraits and nude
studies over several years. Through Modotti, who fast became an accomplished
photographer in her own right, Weston became friendly with artists of the
Mexican Renaissance including Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco, all of whom encouraged his new direction. In 1924 Weston abandoned the use of
soft-focus techniques entirely and started his precise studies of natural forms.
He returned to California permanently in 1926 and began the work for which he is
most deservedly famous: natural-form close-ups,
nudes, and landscapes.</p>
<p>Weston opened a San Francisco studio with his son Brett in 1928. The
following year he moved to Carmel where he began photographing in the Point
Lobos area. He organized with Edward Steichen the American section of the
1929 Stuttgart <i>Film und Foto</i> exhibition at this time. In 1932 Weston was
a founding member of the f/64 group of purist photographers along with Ansel
Adams, Willard Van Dyke, Imogen Cunningham, and Sonya Noskowiak. <i>The Art of
Edward Weston</i>, a book of nearly 40 photographs, was published the same year.</p>
<p>Weston photographed for the WPA Federal Arts Project in New Mexico and
California in 1933. He was the first recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship for
Photography in 1937, photographing extensively in the West and Southwest in
1937-1938. Two years later, he provided illustrations for an edition of
Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i> from photographs made in the South and East.</p>
<p>A major retrospective of 300 prints of Weston's work was held at the
Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1946. Weston began experiments with color
photography the following year, and was the subject of a film, <i>The
Photographer</i>, by Willard Van Dyke.</p>
<p>Weston's work of the late 1940s was hampered by
Parkinson's disease. He took his last photographs in 1948 at Point
Lobos. During the next 10 years of
progressively incapacitating illness, Weston supervised the printing by his
sons, Brett and Cole, of his life's work. His Fiftieth Anniversary Portfolio
appeared in 1952. Three years later, eight sets of prints from 1000 Weston
negatives were produced. Weston died in Carmel in 1958.</p>
