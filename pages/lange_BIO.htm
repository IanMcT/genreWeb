<p><b>Lange, Dorothea</b><br>
American, 1895-1965</p>
<p>As a member of the Farm Security Administration (FSA) photographic unit
under Roy Stryker, Dorothea Lange photographed migrant workers, sharecroppers,
tenant farmers, and other victims of the Depression in 22 states, primarily in
the South and West, between 1935 and 1942. Her &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; (1936)
is one of the classic images of the period.</p>
<p>Lange was born Dorothea Margaretta Nutzhorn in Hoboken, New Jersey, of
German descent. As a young girl she was stricken with polio, which left her with
a lifelong limp which she believed heightened her sensitivity to the sufferings
of others. She attended grade school in New York City's Lower East Side and the
Training School for Teachers also in New York.</p>
<p>In 1914 Lange visited the Fifth Avenue portrait studio of Arnold Genthe;
he gave her her first camera and encouraged her photographic work during the
next year. In 1917-1918 Lange studied at Columbia University with the pictorial
photographer Clarence White. Later in 1918 she became employed as a
photofinisher in San Francisco, where she worked as a freelance photographer and
operated her own studio from 1919 to 1940, at which time she established a
studio in Berkeley, California. In 1932, after a decade as a studio portraitist,
Lange began to photograph people in their social
contexts on the streets of San Francisco. She was the subject of an Oakland, California, exhibition. In
1934 a critical article about Lange written by Willard Van Dyke appeared in
Camera Craft.</p>
<p>With Paul Taylor (whom she later married) Lange began work for the
California Rural Rehabilitation Administration in 1935. The example set by their
efforts was partly responsible for the creation of the photographic unit of the
Federal Resettlement Administration later that year. Lange photographed with the
RA/FSA from 1935 to 1942. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1941 for
&quot;photographic study of the American social scene,&quot; a project she was
prevented from completing by the United States' entry into World War II Lange
worked for the U.S. War Relocation Agency in San Francisco in 1942, and for the
Office of War Information, San Francisco, from 1943 to 1945. Many of her
photographs from this time were lost in transit.</p>
<p>Poor health forced Lange to remain inactive for several years until
1950-1951 when she conducted seminars and participated in photographic
conferences. In 1954-1955 she was a staff photographer with <i>Life</i>
magazine. She worked again as a freelance photographer from 1958 to 1965,
accompanying her husband on U.S. aid assignments in Asia, South America, and the
Middle East. She died of cancer in Marin County, California, in 1965, just
before the opening of her major retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern
Art in New York City.</p>
