<h2>Arnold Newman</h2>

<p>According to Newman, &quot;The portrait is a form
of biography. Its purpose is to inform now and to record for history.&quot; He
reminds us in this straightforward statement that a portrait is a record of a
moment in time, of history writ large and made for the ages — a moment that is
frozen as if in a glacier, to be unearthed by anthropologists in the future.
However, when we start to dig deeper, to scan all the complex information in one
of Newman's photographs, his words &quot;to record for history&quot; become
symbolic of far more. His pictures often hold within them some of the clues to
understanding the personalities he depicts: a colorful mask, an aesthetic
presence, an interior silence, a creative psychology, or a relationship to the
surrounding space or other people. He understands that photography always
reveals some truth in its gaze and creates a fictional paradigm from this
veracity.</p>

<p>Newman's portraits record specific histories and
interpret the personalities he photographs. He connects these to the pictorial
environment that best represents his intuitive understanding of a person. He
creates a visual tension between a moment and a psychological presence. It is
this tension — between the instant we see and the eternity that makes up our
interior lives — that brings these pictures to life. They are not documents of
events but photographs created with broad strokes. They elucidate something as
intangible as a personality, using all available tools to uncover a relationship
between his subjects and their changing world.</p>
