<h3>Formalism vs. Imitationalism: Questions</h3>
<p>1. How might you argue that Karl Blossfeldt's photographs are abstract?</p>
<p>2. Find an example of architectural ornamentation that might have had its
creative inspiration in the world of plants.</p>
<p>3. Blossfeldt's Bio:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Where was he born?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Where did he study?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Where did he teach?</p>
<p>4. In your own words, defend the following statement: <i>Paul Strand was one
of the major forces of photographic modernism.</i></p>
<p>5. Paul Strand had influences from a variety of different artists. Name the
artists from each of the following disciplines that had some impact on his work:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) photography;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) painting;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) sculpture;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) film.</p>
<p>6. In what way is Strand's <i>Church</i> photograph from 1944 a formalist
image?</p>
<p>7. What two events precipitated Weston's break with Pictorialism?</p>
<p>8. Weston wrote, &quot;the camera should be used for a recording of life, for
rendering the very substance and quintessence of the thing itself, whether it be
polished steel or palpitating flesh.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) What does this mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) What evidence can you find in Weston's work to suggest
he was successful in this endeavour?</p>
<p>9. Weston has written that photography should be &quot;<i>direct, honest,
uncompromising</i>&quot;. What technical tricks did he believe should be avoided
by a good photographer?</p>
<p>10. In what way were Friedlander's Guggenheim Fellowships of 1960 and 1962
indicative of his tendency towards imitationalist aesthetics?</p>
<p>11. a) In what way is Lee Friedlander's <i>Factory Valleys No. 13</i>, 1980 a
documentary?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) How does <i>Factory Valleys No. 13 </i>support a
formalist aesthetic?&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. In what way is Lange's work imitationalist?</p>
<p>13. How did Lange earn her living as a photographer?</p>
<p>14. What message is conveyed in Lange's <i>Migrant Mother</i>, 1936?</p>
<p>15. According to Newman, &quot;The portrait is a form of biography.&quot; It
documents a history that is subject to the interpretation of the photographer.
How is this interpretation evident in the following portraits:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) <i>President Lyndon B. Johnson</i>, 1963;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) <i>Willie (The Lion) Smith</i>, 1960;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) <i>Woody Allen</i>, 1996.</p>
<p>16. There are a number of different processes that a photographer might
follow to take pictures of people. In what ways does the process followed by
Arnold Newman differ from that of Dorthea Lange?</p>
<p>17. How has Gary Winogrand's choice of equipment affected his photographic
imagery?</p>
<p>18. What aspects of Winogrand's studies have contributed to his creative
ability?</p>
<p>19. Winogrand's images are narratives — they tell a story. In your own
words, explain the narrative from any one of the Winogrand images presented.</p>
